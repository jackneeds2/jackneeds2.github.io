          <p>My name is Jack Needs I was born in Nampa Idaho, I am married and have two beautiful daughters one is now 24 and <br> 
          the other is now 18 years old. My daughters keep me very busy, I love the outdoors and anytime I can get up a canyon or <br>
          a place I've never been I try to get there. I love to fly fish and take very scenic outdoor images of mostly southwestern <br> 
         Idaho. I have some great images around Yellowston and some in Oregon around the Owyhe river or whereever you would like to <br>
          go in this area. Most of my images you will view under the images link are of Southwestern idaho with some good images of<br>
          the Yellowstone area. I love to fly fish and have been tying my own flies since I was twelve, if you would like for me to <br>
          show you around our great outdoors below is muy contact information, if not enjoy the images of our great outdoors. </p></td>
